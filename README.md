This app helps tourists find attraction to go to.

The Home Screen  of the app displays a custom list of cities which are popular tourist destinations all over the world. Upon drilling down into any of the tourist destinations, the user will be able to see a list of tourist attractions to visit in that city. The user will also be able to get more information about the sight and will be redirected to the Maps app to show directions to the user to visit the place.  

The app reads data from a local JSON file.
